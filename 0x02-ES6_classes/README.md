1. **Defining a Class**: In ES6, you can define a class using the `class` keyword followed by the name of the class. For example:

    ```javascript
    class Animal {
      constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
      }
    }
    ```

2. **Adding Methods to a Class**: You can add methods to a class by defining functions within the class block. These methods will be available on instances of the class.

    ```javascript
    class Animal {
      constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
      }
      
      speak() {
        console.log(`${this.name} makes a noise.`);
      }
    }

    const dog = new Animal('Dog');
    dog.speak(); // Output: Dog makes a noise.
    ```

3. **Static Methods in a Class**: Static methods are methods that are called on the class itself rather than on instances of the class. They are defined using the `static` keyword.

    ```javascript
    class Animal {
      static breathe() {
        console.log('Breathing...');
      }
    }

    Animal.breathe(); // Output: Breathing...
    ```

    Static methods are useful for utility functions or methods that don't require access to instance properties.

4. **Extending a Class**: You can create a subclass that inherits from a superclass using the `extends` keyword.

    ```javascript
    class Dog extends Animal {
      constructor(name, breed) {
        super(name);
        this.breed = breed;
      }
      
      describe() {
        console.log(`${this.name} is a ${this.breed}`);
      }
    }

    const dog = new Dog('Buddy', 'Golden Retriever');
    dog.speak(); // Output: Buddy makes a noise.
    dog.describe(); // Output: Buddy is a Golden Retriever.
    ```

    The `super()` function is used to call the constructor of the superclass.

5. **Metaprogramming and Symbols**: 

    Metaprogramming involves writing code that manipulates other code, typically at runtime. Symbols are a primitive data type introduced in ES6 that serve as unique identifiers.

    You can use symbols for metaprogramming purposes like creating private properties or methods in classes:

    ```javascript
    const secret = Symbol('secret');

    class Animal {
      constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
        this[secret] = 'I am a secret!';
      }

      getSecret() {
        return this[secret];
      }
    }

    const dog = new Animal('Dog');
    console.log(dog.getSecret()); // Output: I am a secret!
    console.log(dog[secret]); // Output: undefined
    ```

    Here, `secret` is a symbol used as a private property to store sensitive information that should not be accessed directly from outside the class.

Understanding these concepts will give you a solid foundation in working with ES6 classes and metaprogramming techniques in JavaScript.
