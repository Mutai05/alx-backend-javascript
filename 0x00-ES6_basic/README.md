ES6 Basics
### What ES6 Is
- **ES6** (ECMAScript 2015) is the sixth edition of the ECMAScript standard, which is the scripting language specification on which JavaScript is based. It introduced major enhancements to the language to make coding in JavaScript more efficient and expressive.

### New Features Introduced in ES6
- **Arrow Functions**: A concise way to write functions using the `=>` syntax.
- **Let and Const**: Block-scoped variable declarations.
- **Template Literals**: Enhanced string literals using backticks (``) and allowing embedded expressions.
- **Default Parameters**: Allowing function parameters to have default values.
- **Destructuring Assignment**: A convenient way to extract values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables.
- **Rest and Spread Operators**: `...` syntax to handle function parameters and arrays.
- **Classes**: A new way to write constructor functions and inheritance using `class` syntax.
- **Modules**: Built-in support for modular code using `import` and `export` statements.
- **Promises**: A new way to handle asynchronous operations.
